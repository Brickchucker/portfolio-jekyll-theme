# About Me

---

I am a 3D Artist working in both digital and physical media. My work focuses heavily on social issues related to class, capitalism, and housing insecurity but I also enjoy exploring utopian concepts and sustainable design. I'm also trained in architectural drafting and design and have experience with specialized fabrication using woodworking and 3D printing.

## **Background**

---

I got my start in Art and Design in 2011 when I was first introduced to *Minecraft*. Throughout middle school and early high school I spent hundreds of hours designing buildings in the game and I was eventually inspired to take architecture and CAD classes in my school's industrial arts program. At the same time, I was playing percussion in band and orchestra and singing with the school choir leading to a very full class schedule followed by cross country in the evenings. In my last semester of high school I was recruited into my family's business, Terra-Dome, to draft floor plans for the earth-sheltered structures they build.

The combination of these interests and skills brought me to the 3D Modeling and Animation program at Truman State University. Being my first exposure to formal arts education, I struggled in the first couple of semesters but eventually got the hang of things. Joining the Bad Acids Printmaking Club and Windfall Literary Magazine definitely helped with this acclimation. About halfway through my digital art degree, I decided to also pursue a studio degree in Sculpture. I've completed my capstone for Sculpture and will be doing my Design capstone in the spring of 2022. Throughout my college experience, I've found out how much I enjoy working with other creative people and I aim to keep making . And that pretty much catches you up!

### **Hobbies**

---

I still enjoy playing video games like *Minecraft*, *SimCity 4*, and *Deep Rock Galactic* and I frequently host board game nights at my apartment. *Terraforming Mars*, *Railroad Ink*, and *Star Realms* are a few of my favorites. I've stopped running for the sake of my knees and instead bike around 5-10 miles a week. If I'm working at my computer or going on a walk, I'll almost always be listening to music.
